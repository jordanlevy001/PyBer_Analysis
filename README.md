# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### The CEO of PyBer has asked us to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. The three city types are: urban, suburban, rural. The CEO also asked us to create a multiple-line graph displaying the total weekly fares for each city type spanning January 2019 to the end of April 2019.

## Results

Overall, there are more rides and more drivers in urban cities than suburban and rural cities. Rural cities have the lowest number of rides, but the average fare price is higher than in suburban and urban cities. The suburban cities have less rides than urban cities but the average fare price is higher than the average fare price in urban cities.

Similar to the results shown in the ride share summary graph, there are a greater number of rides on average in urban cities, followed by suburban cities, followed by rural cities. There is a good spread in the number of rides in urban cities. Of the total rides that occur, most happen in urban cities. Please see the pie chart above for the specific percentages.

There are the most drivers in urban cities. Surburban cities have the second highest number of drivers followed by rural cities. Drivers in urban cities make up the majority of the total drivers. Please see the pie chart above for the specific percentages.

Out of the total fares, urban cities make up the majority. Suburban cities make up the second highest percent of the total fares, 30.5%. 6.8% of the total fares are in rural cities. Please see the pie chart above for all of the specific percentages.

The average fare price is highest in rural cities. There is also high variation in the fare price for rural cities. The second highest fare price is in suburban areas. And urban cities have the lowest fare price on average. Although there are more drivers in urban ares, the average fare price is highest in rural cities.

In January to April of 2019, urban cities generated the highest volume in total fares. Despite the average fare price being the highest in rural cities, urban cities generated the greatest amount in total fares, followed by surburban cities, followed by rural cities. The total fares generated in rural cities each week never exceeded $500. This is relatively low compared to urban cities, which generated $1500-2500 each week in total fares. For all city types, there was a small spike in total fares the last week of February 2019.

## Summary

### The three different city types have different numbers of drivers, rides, average fare cost, and generate varying amounts in total fares. If drivers in an urban city want to make more money with fewer drives, they should consider driving to a rural city to give rides, because while rural cities have less rides on average, drivers tend to make more money per drive in rural cities than drivers in urban cities.
### In urban cities there are many drivers and many rides, thus fare prices are low. Urban cities also generate the greatest amount in total fares despite having the lowest average fare cost. Based on this data, PyBer should focus its efforts on urban cities as they generate the highest revenue.
### If PyBer wants to generate even more revenue, they should raise the fare cost in urban cities. Since there are the most drivers and number of rides occurring in urban areas, if the average fare cost was slightly increased, it would have the greatest impact on increasing the total fares.
### For all city types, there was a small spike in total fares the last week of February 2019. Valentine's Day is a holiday that occurs in the last week of February. It might be beneficial to ensure there are adequate drivers in all city types on special holidays where people tend to rely on ride sharing.
