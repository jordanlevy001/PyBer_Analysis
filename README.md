# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

### The CEO of PyBer has asked us to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. The three city types are: urban, suburban, rural. The CEO also asked us to create a multiple-line graph displaying the total weekly fares for each city type spanning January 2019 to the end of April 2019.
